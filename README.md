## 📖 About Mogu

**Mogu** is the canonical knowledge base for modern internet-native communities.  
It documents the language of movers, the logic of blockchain theory, and the evolving culture of mogus.

From crypto-native slang to cultural archetypes, from technical theory to memetic philosophy —  
Mogu is where terminology becomes timeless.

This is not just a dictionary.  
This is living culture, structured.
